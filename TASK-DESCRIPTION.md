# Detect boats from images/videos using Deep Learning

Your task is to train a machine learning model to recognize boats.
You will use a specified dataset for boat recognition, write a script for detection,
and apply the trained model to a video for real-time boat detection.

- **Dataset**: Use the Ship or Boat Detection Dataset from
  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kunalgupta2616/boat-types-recognition) for training your model.
  This dataset contains images of various types of ships and boats.

- **Model Training**: Train a model using a deep learning framework of your choice (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, YOLO).
  Your model should be able to distinguish between different types of boats.

- **Script for Detection**: Write a script that uses your trained model to detect boats in images.
  The script should output the bounding boxes and class labels for each detected boat.

- **Video Application**: Apply your trained model and detection script to a video.
  The video should be taken from the perspective of another ship (i.e., front view).
  Your model should be able to detect and classify boats in real-time.
